Operaci√≥n Triunfo is a Spanish TV Show focused on music.

This app has been focused on the following article [Recommendation Engine for Songs](https://www.activeloop.ai/resources/3-ways-to-build-a-recommendation-engine-for-songs-with-lang-chain/).

Made with [DeepLake](https://www.deeplake.ai/) üöÄ and [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html) ü¶ú‚õì

## Functionality

The application follows a sequence of steps to deliver Disney songs matching the user's emotions:

User Input: The application starts by collecting user's emotional state through a text input.
Emotion Encoding: The user-provided emotions are then fed to a Language Model (LLM). The LLM interprets and encodes these emotions.
Similarity Search: These encoded emotions are utilized to perform a similarity search within our [vector database](Deep Lake Vector Store in LangChain). This database houses Disney songs, each represented as emotional embeddings.
Song Selection: From the pool of top matching songs, the application randomly selects one. The selection is weighted, giving preference to songs with higher similarity scores.
Song Retrieval: The selected song's embedded player is displayed on the webpage for the user. Additionally, the LLM interpreted emotional state associated with the chosen song is displayed.
