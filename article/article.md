# Exploring Machine Learning for Personalized Music Recommendations

Hello fellow machine learning enthusiasts! 

After several years of working as a Data Engineer, I've embarked on a new journey to delve into the diverse
realms of machine learning. This article marks the beginning of my exploration through various projects aimed at learning
and understanding this fascinating field. While I may be starting with Language Models (LLMs), I view it as an initial
step to ignite my passion and motivation for this new endeavor. Join me as I dive into the world of machine learning,
eager to expand my knowledge and skills. Let's embark on this journey together!

## Introduction



Brief overview of the project and its objective: creating a music recommendation system based on user input sentences.
Introduction to the dataset used (Spotify playlist), and the process of collecting and storing lyrics from the tracks.
Mention the tools and techniques used (DeepLake for vector storage, LLM for emotion extraction, etc.).
Highlight the importance of personalized music recommendations in today's digital age.
Background:

Explain the significance of machine learning in recommendation systems.
Provide an overview of existing approaches to music recommendation systems.
Introduce the concept of using emotions as a feature for recommendation systems.
Briefly discuss the challenges faced in building personalized recommendation systems.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Detail the process of downloading the Spotify playlist and extracting lyrics from the tracks.
Explain the choice of VectorDB (DeepLake) for storing the lyrics.
Discuss any preprocessing steps applied to the data, such as text cleaning or normalization.

## Approaches:

### First Approach:

Describe the initial approach of calculating cosine similarity between user sentences and track lyrics.
Discuss the limitations or challenges encountered with this approach.
### Second Approach:

Explain the use of LLM (Language Model) for emotion extraction from lyrics.
Detail the process of mapping lyrics to a set of 8 emotions and storing them in VectorDB.
Discuss the translation of user sentences to emotions and similarity calculation using embeddings.
Present the improvement in results compared to the first approach.
### Third Approach:

Introduce the refinement in emotion extraction by considering variations and avoiding duplicates.
Explain how this refinement contributes to better recommendation results.
Provide insights into the effectiveness of this approach compared to the previous ones.

## Conclusion
Results and Evaluation:

Present the results obtained from each approach, including performance metrics and user feedback.
Discuss any challenges or limitations encountered during evaluation.
Provide a comparative analysis of the three approaches, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.
Discussion:

Interpret the findings from the experiments and their implications.
Discuss the potential applications of the developed recommendation system.
Reflect on the significance of emotions in enhancing personalized recommendations.
Address any future improvements or extensions to the project.
Conclusion:

Summarize the key findings and contributions of the project.
Reiterate the importance of personalized music recommendations and the role of machine learning in achieving this goal.
Encourage further research and exploration in this domain.
